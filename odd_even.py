#even number ?
#-->if any number is divided by
#2 and reminder is 0 then that number

#is called even number otherwise call
#odd number#%reminder

num = int(input())
if (num % 2==0):

else:
    print("The number is odd")

    

    #The prime number is division by 1 and its self is to be call prime numbers.

#Algorithm
#step:1 ->start
#step:2 -> input number
#step:3 -> divide number by 1 , 2 ,3 ......until less than and equal to input number
#step:4 ->count if number is divide or remainder ) 
#step :5 -> count is greater than 2 , then print "it is composite number"
#step :6 -> otherwise print prime numberS



# :top
# remainder =number%start
# if remainder ==0:
#     count =count +1
# if start<+number:
#     start =start+1
#     goto: top
# if(count>2):
#     print("It is composite Numbers:")
# else:
#     print("It is Prime Number")
